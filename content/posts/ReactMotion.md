react-motion is an excellent library for adding flair and polish to UI interactions in your React apps. Its API, however, is quite terse and can at times seem unpleasantly opaque. The purpose of this tutorial is to go over some basic usage of react-motion's Motion and StaggeredMotion components as well as its spring() function. This tutorial is by no means exhaustive and intentionally stays away from more advanced usage of the library for the sake of simplicity. So, let's get started.

##Spring

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Motion, spring } from 'react-motion'

export default class MotionExample extends Component {
  render() {
    return (

    )
  }
}
```
